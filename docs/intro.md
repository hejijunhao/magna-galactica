Magna Galactica is your counter-proposal to the internet of algorithmic sludge and timid curation. It’s a knowledge-first media universe built around one idea: people should be able to explore information freely, deeply, and on their own terms — without being force-fed whatever optimises watch-time or fits inside someone’s moderation comfort zone.
At its core, MG draws from three traditions:


YouTube’s scale and immediacy — the world’s audiovisual knowledge, without gatekeeping.


Pinterest-style curation — ideas and sources arranged into meaningful structures instead of endless feeds.


Wikipedia/Reddit’s spirit of inquiry — learning, debate, and discovery over passive consumption.


Architecturally, MG starts lean. It embeds external videos rather than hosting them, staying infra-light while focusing on what actually matters: how information is organised, contextualised, and made useful.
Philosophically, it rejects the modern feed’s infantilising filters. No censorship beyond the obvious. No algorithm deciding what you “should” see. No burying uncomfortable history or ideas. Just an open, structured, human-centric library where meaning drives curation, not addiction.
It begins as a clean, uncensored video library: videos + context + conversation.
MG layers commentary, metadata, references, summaries, timelines, and cross-topic links around each video — turning isolated content into part of a larger conceptual map.
Under every video sits a Reddit/X-style discussion thread where people can argue, annotate, and genuinely add knowledge. Conversation becomes part of the context, not noise around it.
Early on, there’s no overreach: no bloated social graph, no heavy hosting, no identity circus. Just a space where the world’s video knowledge can be explored with freedom, structure, and adult-level curiosity.
That’s the spine. The long-term vision can grow from here, but the starting point is intentionally simple:
Magna Galactica = Videos → Context → Conversation → Understanding.
